## General Rules

### Code Quality
- Do NOT add comments in the code under any circumstances
- Do NOT add README files, documentation files, or explanatory text
- Do NOT change existing behavior unless explicitly instructed
- Do NOT introduce breaking changes
- Do NOT duplicate code
- Do NOT add unused files, functions, or exports

### Design & Architecture
- Follow **Single Responsibility Principle** strictly
  - One file = one responsibility
  - One function = one responsibility
- Follow **SOLID principles** at all times
- Keep logic modular and decoupled
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Avoid tight coupling between modules

### Code Structure
- Keep files small and focused
- Split large files into multiple files when responsibilities grow
- Group related logic into appropriate modules/folders
- Ensure clear separation between:
  - Business logic (Services)
  - Data access (Repositories)
  - External integrations
  - Utilities/helpers

### Naming Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive, and consistent naming
- Follow existing project naming patterns exactly
- Avoid abbreviations unless already used in the codebase
- File names, variables, functions, and classes must reflect their responsibility

### Code Quality Standards
- Write clean, readable, and predictable code
- Prefer explicit logic over clever shortcuts
- Avoid side effects
- Handle errors gracefully without adding extra logs unless already present
- Do not introduce console logs or debug statements

### Imports & Exports
- Remove unused imports
- Export only what is necessary
- Keep import order consistent with the existing codebase
